it was quite easy just login to ssh server on "bandit.labs.overthewire.org"  with "bandit0" as username and "bandit0 " as password on port 2220 with the command `ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org` and enter the password when prompted. then read the content of "readme" file where you'll get the password for the next level. 

The password was "ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If".
