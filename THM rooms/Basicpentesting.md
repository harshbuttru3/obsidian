#Questions_and_answers
1. Hidden directory on the webserver ('development') via dirb/gobuster/nikto.
2. Username ('jan' and 'kay' found via enum4linux).
3. password ('jan:armando' found via hydra for ssh).
4. sent linpeas.sh file from local machine to ssh@jan via the command ('scp /path/to/linpeas.sh jan@ip:/dev/shm)

#Found_credentials
1. password of (ssh@jan= armando) found via hydra
2. id_rsa found for user kay via linpeass and cracked passphrase("beeswax") via ssh2john.

#steps
1. Enumerated Hidden directories via dirb/gobuster/nikto/etc. found a directory "development". where got the details of server which was apache struts 2.5.12 which is quite vulnerable but didn't enumerated that.
2. started enum4linux for the target ip. found 2 users ('jan' and 'kay').
3. bruteforced user 'jan' via hydra using the command (hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://ip -t 16). where -l specifies the username to use, since we know the username in this case therefore used small l in "-l", and wanted to find the password for the user "jan" therefore used the capital p in "-P".
4. Got the password in sometime(depending upon the power of cpu), the password was "armando". after logging in with the user "jan", we got that we have very little privilges. 
5. Then, we sent the linpeas.sh script to the ssh@jan via the command "scp /usr/share/peass/linpeas/linpeas.sh jan@ip:/dev/shm".
6. gave the executable permissions to that file via "chmod +x linpeas.sh" and executed the file got the id_rsa of ssh for user "kay".
7. copy that id_rsa to local machine and cracked that via ssh2john. 
8. the gave the required permissions (chmod 600 id_rsa). and sshed to john via rsa file (ssh -i id_rsa kay@ip).
9. Entered the passphrased which we got from john the ripper.
10. we are in the system now of user "kay".
11. got he final answer for the THM.
