I done my matriculation from gyan bharti public school, laxmisagar, darbhanga. and 12th from CM Science college.  I am very proud to represent the rich culture of my region, Mithila, and I also speak Maithili, which is deeply connected to our local heritage. Growing up in this culturally vibrant part of Bihar, I've always been fascinated by our traditions, festivals, and art forms, like the famous Madhubani paintings. I am excited about the _Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat_ camp because it’s a wonderful opportunity to share my culture and learn from others across the country. I believe this experience will help me understand India’s diversity and inspire me to contribute to our unity."**
